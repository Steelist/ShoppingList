GENERAL INFO

    The features took much longer than what I had anticipated. This is what caused
	the unfortunate lack of features. Some of my plans for each day got pushed to the
	next day again and again and I had to solve much more problems than what I had
	anticipated. This is why I decided to do as well as I can the features that I was
	having troubles with and leave all the unnecessary bonus features out. This way
	I would kind of learn less but I would learn the things I looked into much better.
	I think that was the right call for me as I'm not super smart about programming
	yet. Now I know to prepare myself a little better next time and I'm again a little
	smarter.
