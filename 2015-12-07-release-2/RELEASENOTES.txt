GENERAL INFO

	Lists can now be saved to the location where the application was ran
	from and they can also be opened and modified. Because of the 
	insufficient time spent on the second release all the time was spent
	on searching for a working way to handle saving and opening the text 
	files. The next (and final) release will include the planned features
	of the second release and its own planned features.
